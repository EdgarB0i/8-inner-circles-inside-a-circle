# 8-inner-circles-inside-a-circle
A python program that takes user input for radius and center(x,y) and displays an appropriate circle in OpenGL. Additionally, 8 inner circles are shown.
The python program uses midpoint circle algorithm to calculate the specific co-ordinates in different Zones.
You can get a trippy/random color generating circle by editing the glColor3d section.
Since the size of the window is 500X500 (glutInitWindowSize(500, 500)), the maximum radius you can use to see the full circle is 250.
